  - **Collision**: HC-SR04 Ultrasonic (GPIO)
  - **Battery**: INA219 (I2C)
  - **TPMS**: SP370 (433MHz)
  - **Speed**: Hall Effect Sensor (GPIO pulse counting)
  - **Brake**: Pressure Sensor MPX5700DP (ADC)

## System Architecture
### Node Distribution
1. **Vehicle Control Unit (VCU)**
   - Main controller handling V2X communication
   - WiFi/BLE configuration
   - MQTT broker communication
   - CAN message routing

2. **Sensor Nodes (Individual ECUs)**
   - Temperature Monitoring ECU
   - Location & Speed ECU
   - Collision Detection ECU
   - Battery Management ECU
   - Brake System ECU
   - TPMS ECU

### Communication Architecture
- **Internal**: CAN bus (500kbps)
- **External**: 
  - MQTT for cloud communication
  - BLE for initial configuration
  - BLE for V2V communication

- Zephyr device drivers
  - CAN: TWAI driver (ESP32's native CAN)
  - I2C: Replace with Zephyr's I2C API
  - GPIO: Zephyr GPIO subsystem
  - ADC: Zephyr ADC API for analog sensors

### 2. Basic Software Layer
#### Communication Stack
- CAN Stack
  - ISO-TP protocol support
  - J1939 protocol implementation

### 3. Runtime Environment
- Signal-based communication (AUTOSAR-inspired)
- Event handling
- Task scheduling
- Inter-process communication

### 4. Application Layer
- Sensor Management
- Vehicle Tracking
- Cloud Communication
- Diagnostic Services

## Safety & Security Features
